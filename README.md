## Cover letter

I've worked across functions over my professional career, frontend and android were my roots and back-end the place where I found my passion.
I like to think myself as a strongly oriented engineer, a person who takes a problem, goes as deep as possible in the analysis and takes ownership in designing a solution and rolling into reality.
It's in backend where I've found the place where the perfect place where to put my self projection into action and actions. Also, due to a broader hands-on experience I can take other roles, like architecture oriented or even devops leaning.  

After many years in the software industry I've come to terms of deciding to put my hands, time and energy into projects that meet certain ethical principles I bow for. This means I'm looking for a company that advocates for open source and takes care of such needed ecosystem, but also that develops software that has profound positive impact in people's life.
